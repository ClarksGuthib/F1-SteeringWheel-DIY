MERCEDES F1-Inspired DIY Steering Wheel
This is a custom-built, Mercedes F1 steering wheel–inspired project, designed for sim racing and DIY enthusiasts.
The model is heavily experimental and requires significant physical tweaking, sanding, and fitting. Expect to use tools like an electric grinder, file set, and precision drill to achieve proper fitment.
This project combines 3D printing, electronics, and hydro dipping to create a realistic F1-style wheel with working electronics such as buttons, encoders, rotary switches, RGB LEDs, and displays.
⚠️ Note: This is not a beginner-friendly build. Some parts require patience, customization, and modification. Expect trial and error during assembly.

Features
-3D-printed body with optional hydro-dipped carbon fiber finish
-Functional 3.5” ILI9488 TFT LCD driven by ESP32
-Arduino Pro Micro handling button and input mapping
-Multiple rotary switches and encoders for F1-style controls
-Hall effect sensor for analog input (clutch)
-WS2812B RGB LED strip for rev lights and visual effects
-Alcantara wrap for a realistic racing feel
-GX16 aviator connectors for modular wiring and easy detachment
-Perfboard wiring base for stability and custom circuits

Assembly Notes
-Fitment: Some 3D-printed parts may not align perfectly. Test fit often and expect trimming.
-Finishing: Sanding, hydro dipping, and Alcantara wrapping are recommended for durability and aesthetics.
-Electronics: Requires soldering on perfboard, wiring encoders, and careful management of button inputs.
-Tools Required: Electric grinder/Dremel, soldering iron, drill set, precision screwdrivers, multimeter.
